# 📊 AdventureWorks Power BI Dashboard
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard project built using the **AdventureWorks** dataset. The goal of this project is to analyze business performance across orders, revenue, returns, and product categories—leveraging advanced Power BI features to derive actionable insights.

## 🚀 Project Overview
AdventureWorks is a fictional bicycle manufacturing company commonly used for demonstrating data analytics capabilities. In this project, I used the dataset to build a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard covering key business metrics.

### 🔍 Key Business Insights
- 📦 **Order Performance** – Analyze order volumes by product, category, subcategory, and region.
- 💰 **Revenue Trends** – Track revenue over time with dynamic filters by geography, product hierarchy, and customer segments.
- 🔁 **Returns Analysis** – Explore return trends by region, category, and time period to identify potential issues.
- 🌍 **Geographical Sales Insights** – Interactive maps and charts to assess regional business performance.
- 📈 **KPIs** – Key metrics like Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value, Return Rate, and Net Revenue.
